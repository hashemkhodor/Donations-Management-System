# DMS (Donation Management System)
## Motivation
In recent years, the Lebanse economy has been collapsing. Many Lebanese people living in Berqayel, who were already in need of help, became asphixiated by the sudden surge of the prices. They became unable to meet their basic need. As cliche as it may sound, a group of students decided to make a change. We , the students, collaborated with Al Taalouf Association to help them ensure helping as many people as possible. And from here, the idea of DMS (donation management system) sprouted. 


## Mission:
